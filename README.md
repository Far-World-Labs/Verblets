# Verblets

What if we could rebuild the fundamental building blocks of software with human-like intelligence woven into their very fabric?

Verblets are an experiment in reimagining computation itself. Instead of forcing human concepts into rigid computer structures, what if our programs could understand and work with information as naturally as we do?

## Imagine...

### A New Kind of Sorting
Remember the last time you shopped online and used those rigid "Sort by price" or "Sort by rating" buttons? What if you could sort by anything you can express in words?

```javascript
await sort(products, "by how perfect they'd be as a gift for a tech-savvy teenager");
```

Or imagine sorting a list of movies not just by year or rating, but by "how likely they are to make you think about life differently" or "which would be best for a first date."

### Lists That Think
Traditional programming treats lists as simple collections of items. But what if lists could understand context and generate themselves intelligently?

```javascript
await list("indie coffee shops in Brooklyn that feel like they're from a Wes Anderson movie");
```

### Questions That Understand
Instead of rigid form fields and dropdown menus, what if your application could engage in natural dialogue to understand exactly what your users want?

```javascript
await intent("I'm looking for a cozy place to work that serves great espresso and isn't too crowded in the mornings");
```

## The Vision

Verblets are an exploration of what becomes possible when we inject intelligence into the most fundamental operations of software. Every basic operation - comparing, sorting, filtering, transforming - can be reimagined with the power of large language models.

This isn't just about making existing software slightly better. It's about unlocking entirely new categories of applications that weren't possible before. Imagine:

- Search engines that truly understand what you're looking for
- Recommendation systems that catch subtle nuances of taste and context
- Data analysis tools that can answer complex, nuanced questions about your data
- Content management systems that organize information the way humans naturally think about it

## Getting Started

```javascript
import { sort, list, intent } from '@far-world-labs/verblets';

// The possibilities are endless...
```

## Contributing

We're at the beginning of exploring what's possible when we rebuild software's basic primitives with intelligence at their core. If you're excited about this vision, we'd love your help in pushing the boundaries further.
