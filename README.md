# Verblets

Verblets rebuild the basic operations of software with language model intelligence. Each verblet takes a combination of natural language and structured input and returns structured data. Like applications, verblets are powerful utilities on their own, or they can be strategically applied to in traditional software.  

## Examples

```javascript
// Make complex decisions with context
await bool(
  `Should we deploy this change?
   <git>
   Files: 3 changed (150+, 20-)
   Tests: 247 passing
   Time: Friday 4:45 PM
   </git>`
); // Returns: false (risky deploy time)

// Generate and sort large lists by any criteria
await sort(list("music merch for teens"), "by likelihood of driving business growth in Q3");

// Break down complex systems into components
await dismantle("AirPods Pro");
/* Returns:
{
  "name": "AirPods Pro",
  "components": [
    { "name": "H2 Chip", "role": "audio_processing" },
    { "name": "Drivers", "type": "custom_dynamic" },
    { "name": "Noise Sensors", "count": 2 },
    { "name": "Battery", "type": "lithium_ion" }
  ]
}
*/

// Generate intelligent questions to explore topics
await questions("why isn't my sourdough starter rising?");
/* Returns:
[
  "What's the room temperature where you keep it?",
  "When was it last fed?",
  "What type of flour are you using?",
  "What's the feeding ratio?"
]
*/

// Structure natural descriptions into data
await toObject(
  "Grandma's chicken soup: simmered for 3 hours with carrots, celery, and love",
  { type: "Recipe", required: ["cookTime", "ingredients"] }
);
/* Returns:
{
  "name": "Grandma's Chicken Soup",
  "cookTime": "PT3H",
  "ingredients": ["chicken", "carrots", "celery"],
  "method": "simmer"
}
*/

// Structure data in universal formats
await schemaOrg("WWDC 2024");
/* Returns:
{
  "@type": "Event",
  "name": "Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2024",
  "startDate": "2024-06-10",
  "endDate": "2024-06-14",
  "location": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "Apple Park",
    "addressLocality": "Cupertino"
  }
}
*/
```

## Reference

### Data Extraction

- **enum** - Map language to defined options. LLMs often hallucinate and come up with wildly incorrect output. Many of the verblet functions use the intelligence of an LLM but constrain the output to controlled values that will not break your software.

  ```javascript
  // Map natural questions to specific choices
  const color = await enum(
    "What color should I stop at in traffic?",
    {
      green: 1,   // Safe to go
      yellow: 1,  // Prepare to stop
      red: 1      // Must stop
    }
  ); // Returns: 'red'

- **number-with-units** - Extract, convert, and standardize measurements
  ```javascript
  // Handles any measurement in any format
  const speed = await numberWithUnits("Mach 2.5");
  /* Returns:
  {
    "value": 2716.5,
    "unit": "kilometers_per_hour",
    "original": {
      "value": 2.5,
      "unit": "mach"
    }
  }
  */

- **schema.org** - Structure data using universal formats, enabling radical system interop.
  ```javascript
  // Places, events, products, etc. in standard formats any system can use
  const place = await schemaOrg("Kyoto Station");
  /* Returns:
  {
    "@type": "TrainStation",
    "name": "Kyoto Station",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "addressCountry": "JP",
      "addressLocality": "Kyoto"
    },
    "publicTransport": {...}
  }
  */

- **to-object** - Transform unstructured text into structured data
  ```javascript
  // Convert natural descriptions into structured data
  const data = await toObject("A red 2023 Tesla Model 3");
  /* Returns:
  {
    "vehicle": {
      "make": "Tesla",
      "model": "Model 3",
      "year": 2023,
      "color": "red"
    }
  }
  */

  // Enforce specific data structure with schemas
  const carSchema = {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      make: { type: "string" },
      year: { type: "number" },
      features: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" }}
    },
    required: ["make", "year"]
  };
  
  const structured = await toObject(
    "2024 BMW M3 with heated seats and lane assist",
    carSchema
  );
  /* Returns:
  {
    "make": "BMW",
    "year": 2024,
    "features": [
      "heated seats",
      "lane assist"
    ]
  }
  */
  ```

- **bool** - Transform questions into clear true/false decisions
  ```javascript
  // Evaluate factual queries
  const isCompatible = await bool(
    `Is Python ${versionA} backwards compatible with Python ${versionB} code?`
  ); // Returns: false
  ```

- **number** - Extract numerical values from natural language
  ```javascript
  // Extract numbers from questions about recipes
  const servings = await number(
    "If the recipe serves 6 and I'm cooking for 15 people, how many batches do I need?"
  ); // Returns: 2.5

  // Get numerical answers about everyday situations
  const weeks = await number(
    "My baby is 98 days old - how many weeks is that?"
  ); // Returns: 14

  // Handle questions that can't be answered
  const impossible = await number(
    "How many stars are visible from my backyard?"
  ); // Returns: undefined (depends on location, weather, light pollution)
  ```

  const map = new SummaryMap({ targetTokens: 600 });

  // Add different types of content with weights
  map.set('contract.terms', {
    value: `Pursuant to the stipulations delineated herein, 
    the parties hereto, designated as Party A (the "Grantor") 
    and Party B (the "Grantee"), do hereby irrevocably...`,
    weight: 0.3  // Give it 30% of the token budget
  });

  map.set('app.encryption', {
    value: `
    function encodeDecode(input, seed) {
      let key = _generateKey(seed, input.length);
      return _xorStrings(input, key);
    }

      let curr = seed;
      for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        curr = (1664525 * curr + 1013904223) % 4294967296;
        key += String.fromCharCode(curr % 256);
      }
      return key;
    }`,
    type: 'code',  // Special handling for code

  const result = await map.pavedSummaryResult();
  /* Returns:
  {
    "contract": {
      "terms": "Agreement between Grantor (Party A) and Grantee (Party B) 
                regarding water usage rights, focusing on reasonable use and 
                ecological balance."
    },
    "app": {
      "encryption": `
        function encodeDecode(input, seed)
        function _generateKey(seed, length)
        // Implements XOR-based encryption using a seeded key generator

    ## Rate Limiting
    Requests are limited to 100 per minute.
    Exceeding this will result in a 429 response.
    
    ## Endpoints
    GET /users - Retrieve user list
    POST /users - Create new user
    DELETE /users/{id} - Remove user`;

  const compact = await shortenText(documentation, {

## Audio Transcription

The `Transcriber` class captures speech and converts it to text using local CLI tools. By default it stores temporary audio files in `~/.cache/verblets` on Linux or in the directory specified by `VERBLETS_CACHE_DIR`. Files are removed after processing, and you can call `cleanupCache()` to remove any leftover artifacts.
