COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT PROTOCOL FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES MANAGEMENT

1. INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. This protocol outlines evidence-based approaches for managing T2DM in adult patients. The prevalence of T2DM has increased dramatically over the past decades, affecting approximately 10% of the adult population in developed countries.

2. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
T2DM develops through a combination of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and progressive beta-cell dysfunction. Multiple factors contribute including genetics, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and aging. The disease progression involves initial compensatory hyperinsulinemia followed by beta-cell exhaustion and frank hyperglycemia.

3. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
Diagnosis is established by any of the following:
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL
- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL during OGTT
- HbA1c ≥6.5%
- Random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL with classic symptoms

4. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS
All patients should receive counseling on:
- Diet: Mediterranean or DASH diet patterns, carbohydrate counting
- Exercise: 150 minutes moderate activity weekly
- Weight loss: 5-10% reduction if overweight
- Smoking cessation
- Stress management techniques

5. PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT

First-Line Therapy:
METFORMIN
- Starting dose: 500mg once or twice daily with meals
- Target dose: 1000mg twice daily
- Maximum dose: 2550mg daily
- Contraindications: eGFR <30, acute illness, contrast procedures
- Side effects: GI upset, B12 deficiency, rare lactic acidosis
- Monitoring: Annual B12 levels, renal function every 3-6 months

Second-Line Options (if HbA1c remains >7%):

SULFONYLUREAS (e.g., Glipizide)
- Starting dose: 2.5-5mg daily
- Maximum: 20mg daily
- Risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain
- Avoid in renal impairment

DPP-4 INHIBITORS (e.g., Sitagliptin)
- Dose: 100mg daily
- Renal dose adjustment required
- Weight neutral, low hypoglycemia risk
- Monitor for pancreatitis

GLP-1 AGONISTS (e.g., Liraglutide)
- Starting: 0.6mg subcutaneous daily
- Increase weekly to 1.2-1.8mg daily
- Benefits: weight loss, cardiovascular protection
- Side effects: nausea, injection site reactions

SGLT2 INHIBITORS (e.g., Empagliflozin)
- Dose: 10-25mg daily
- Benefits: weight loss, blood pressure reduction, heart/kidney protection
- Risks: genital infections, DKA, volume depletion
- Avoid if eGFR <45

Insulin Therapy:
- Consider when HbA1c >10% or symptomatic
- Start with basal insulin 0.1-0.2 units/kg/day
- Titrate by 2 units every 3 days until fasting glucose 80-130 mg/dL
- Add prandial insulin if HbA1c remains elevated

6. MONITORING
- HbA1c every 3 months until stable, then every 6 months
- Annual: lipids, urine albumin, eye exam, foot exam
- Blood pressure at each visit
- Self-monitoring of blood glucose as indicated

7. COMPLICATIONS SCREENING
Regular screening for microvascular and macrovascular complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease is essential for comprehensive care.

8. SPECIAL POPULATIONS
Elderly patients, pregnant women, and those with significant comorbidities require individualized approaches with modified glycemic targets and medication selections.
