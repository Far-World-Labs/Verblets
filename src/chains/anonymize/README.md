# anonymize

Remove personal style, references, and formatting from text to conceal the original author. The chain runs through your configured LLM models, so it works with fully private or selfâ€‘hosted LLMs.

Supported methods: `STRICT`, `BALANCED`, and `LIGHT` to control how aggressively style is removed.


```javascript
import anonymize, { anonymizeMethod } from './index.js';

const message = `As a software lead in Chicago, I've found our new UI framework helps junior devs ramp up fast.`;

const { text } = await anonymize({
  text: message,
  method: anonymizeMethod.STRICT,
});

console.log(text);
// => "The new UI framework shortens the learning curve for new developers."
```
