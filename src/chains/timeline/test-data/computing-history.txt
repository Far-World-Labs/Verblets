The history of computing begins in ancient times with the abacus, developed around 2400 BCE in Mesopotamia. 
For millennia, this remained the primary calculating tool.

The next major breakthrough came in 1642 when Blaise Pascal invented the Pascaline, a mechanical calculator.
This was followed by Gottfried Leibniz's stepped reckoner in 1673.

The 19th century saw Charles Babbage design the Difference Engine in 1822 and the Analytical Engine in 1837,
though neither was completed in his lifetime. Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm intended for processing
by Babbage's Analytical Engine in 1843, making her arguably the first computer programmer.

The 20th century brought rapid advancement. Alan Turing published his paper on computability in 1936,
laying theoretical foundations for computer science. During World War II, the Colossus computer was built
in 1943 to break German codes, while ENIAC, completed in 1945, became the first general-purpose electronic computer.

The transistor was invented at Bell Labs in December 1947, revolutionizing electronics. IBM introduced
the first commercial computer, the 701, in 1952. The integrated circuit was invented in 1958 by Jack Kilby.

The 1960s saw the development of ARPANET in 1969, the precursor to the internet. The microprocessor
was invented by Intel in 1971. Microsoft was founded in April 1975, followed by Apple in April 1976.

The IBM PC was released in August 1981, standardizing personal computing. Tim Berners-Lee invented
the World Wide Web in 1989, with the first website going live in 1991. Google was founded in September 1998.

The 21st century brought social media with Facebook launching in February 2004, Twitter in March 2006,
and the iPhone revolutionizing mobile computing in June 2007. Cloud computing became mainstream around 2010.

Recent developments include the rise of artificial intelligence, with OpenAI releasing GPT-3 in June 2020
and ChatGPT in November 2022, marking a new era in human-computer interaction.
