# JSON Schemas

This folder contains example schemas used throughout the project. Schemas are referenced by certain verblets and chains for validating or shaping structured output.

Included files:

- `cars-test.json`
- `intent.json`
- `schema-dot-org-photograph.json`
- `schema-dot-org-place.json`
- `index.js` â€“ helper that loads a subset of schemas for quick access.

Additional schemas may live alongside the modules that use them (for example in `../verblets` or `../chains`).
